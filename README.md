This script can convert a number of jpegs for a series into a single PDF file.
For example, an input of:

Example Input: Naruto_One //whatever you want to name your pdf
PDF Name: https://www.mangareader.net/Naruto/1 //link to the site

Will create a Naruto_One.pdf file in the folder where you run main.
The script takes care of cleaning up all the downloaded JPEG files.
This script uses bs4, PIL, os, and requests.
